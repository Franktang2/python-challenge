# Python Challenge

Python scripts used to help analyze budget/financial data (PyBank) and to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process (PyPoll).

## Background

For this project, I created two Python scripts:

**PyBank**

Inside the PyBank folder, you will find a script that is used to help analyze budget/financial data for a company. The data is in a csv file and includes two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

When you run the script, the script analyzes the profit/losses numbers and calculates the following:

-The total number of months included in the dataset.

-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

-The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.

-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


**PyPoll**

Inside the PyPoll folder, you will find a script that is used to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The data is in a csv file and includes three columns, Voter ID, County, and Candidate.

When you run the script, the script analyzes the votes and calculates the following:

-The total number of votes cast.

-List of candidates who received votes.

-The percentage of votes each candidate won.

-The total number of votes each candidate won.

-The winner of the election based on popular vote.


## Technologies used

The following technologies were used to build the scripts:

-Python

-Pandas

-Jupyter Notebook
